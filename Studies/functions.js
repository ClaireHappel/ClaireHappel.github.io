/* *
 *  2. What's the difference between a function's parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
 *  
 *     A parameter is a variable used as a placeholder within a function. Arguments are the values within the function 
 *     call itself- while they can be a variable representing a data type, they can also be any data type (for example,
 *     you could use the variable numArray or an actual array such as [1, 2, 3]). When these arguments are passed through 
 *     the function, they will be used in the places the parameter holds for them.

/* *
 *  5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we
       specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?

/* *
 *  6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is not true.
 * 
 * 
 * */

/* *
 *  7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object is returned from the function
 *     and is held in memory somewhere (reference), that closure stays alive, and data can continue to exist
 *     in these closures.
