 *  0. LOOPS
 *  
 *  Loops give us to ability to iterate over something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all 
 *  achieve the same goal of repeating an action some number of times. The different loop mechanisms offer different 
 *  ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. Certain loops are used over others depending on what 
 *  goal we are trying to accomplish and what data types we are working with. Data types such as strings and arrays,
 *  for example, are often iterated over with a for loop. Objects meanwhile, often are iterated over with a for-in
 *  loop. While loops can be used when we are unsure of how many times we will need to loop while for loops are best
 *  used when we know the number of times we want to loop.
 *

/* *
 *  1. Explain while, for, and for-in loops
 * 
 *  A while loop executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement's syntax is 
 *  while, followed by some condition specified, with a statement to be fufilled so long as the condition is true. To iterate
 *  over values properly, it is important to iterate whatever starting value you are using within the statement portion of the 
 *  while loop. The looping will stop after the condition turns false- setting a condition that will never turn false will
 *  result in an infinite loop being created. While loops can use break statements and continue statements in order to control
 *  where the looping ends specifically. In a while loop, continue will cause the looping to jumps back to the condition.
 * 
 *  For loops repeat until a condition evaluates to false. A for statement's syntax includes for immeadiately followed by a
 *  parentheses. Within these parentheses are the initial value our for loop will loop over- for example this could be a 
 *  number or the index of array. After this, there is a condition specified that once met, will cause our for loop to stop.
 *  Lastly, we have what's known as the afterthought, an expression that will be executed on each loop. Frequently this is 
 *  used for incrementation (or step) within our loop. Following all of this is the statement(s) that will be executed each
 *  loop.For loops can also use both break and continue statements. In a for loop, the continue will jump to the 
 *  increment-expression.
 * 
 *  A for-in loop is a bit different from other loops in that it is specifically used to loop over objects. As such, it has
 *  a distinct syntax. It starts with a for that is followed by a set of parantheses containing the declaration of a variable.
 *  This variable declaration is immeadiately followed by the word "in" and the object's name. This is then followed by a statement,
 *  Accessing the object in this way allows for both keys and values in the key/value pairs to be accessed easily. For-in loops
 *  would not be used for any looping where the index value is important, and thus arrays and strings tend to be accessed with 
 *  for loops instead.
 *

     // While Loop: 

     var whileArr = ['w', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'e']; // the array we're looping through

     let start = 0; // this is acting as the starting point for our loop 

     while (start < whileArr.length) { // the condition- while start is less than the length of the array
       console.log(whileArr[start].split(' ')); // => ['w'] 
       start++; // increment start by one       //    ['h']
     }                                          //    ['i']

                                                //    ['e'] is logged to console

     // For Loop:

     let forLoopArr = [ "f", "o", "r" ]; // the array we're looping over

                                                   //    note that the output is a string of the letters, a semicolon, and their respective indexes in the array

     // For-in Loop:

     let forInLoopMe = { //the object we're looping over
        name: 'Claire',
        objective: 'To become better at JavaScript every day.',
        whatLoopsOverObjects: 'A for-in loop!'
     };

     for (let key in forInLoopMe) {
       
        console.log(key); // =>  name
                          //     objective
                          //     whatLoopsOverObjects is logged to console
       
     }                    // if we wanted values, we could use forInLoopMe[key] instead

/* *
 *  2. Be able to loop any number of times, forward counting up to some limit and backward counting down to 0.
 *  
 *  Looping to a nonspecific value and looping backward can both be achieved with both for loops and while 
 *  loops. In general, for loops tend to be prefered when we know the number of times we need to loop- 
 *  and a while loop would be used if you needed to hit some other condition other than the number of times.
 *  You would never use a for-in loop for either of these cases because they do not strictly involve objects.

/* *
 *  3. Loop over an array, forwards and backwards
 *  
 *  Looping over an array positively requires an incrementation of the initial value we placed as the start
 *  of our loop. If we wanted to loop over every value, we would use an incrementation value of 1, which can
 *  be written in one of three ways: x = x + 1, x += 1, or x++. In the case of an array moving backwards, we
 *  would need to use a decrement instead of an increment. If we wanted to decrement the value each time by
 *  1, we could do so in the following ways: x = x - 1, x-= 1, or x--. It is also possible to decrement or 
 *  increment by a prefix value instead of a postfix value (++x and --x instead of x++ and x--) and the 
 *  specifications on what that would entail can be found within the Operators section of this project.

            forMessage += array[i]; // for each loop, add the string value at each index to forMessage and reassign forMessage to this value
        }
       return forMessage; // before returning all the letters
     }

     console.log(forwarding(forward)) // => 'forward' is logged to the console

/* *
 *  4. Loop over an object
 * 
 *  For-in loops are ideal for looping over objects. For-in loops allow easy access to both keys and values,
 *  which means they are a wonderful tool to fully access objects. While we would not use for-in loops on an 
 *  array due to indexing- objects do not have an order, making them perfect for for-in loops. In the case 
 *  of an array of objects- pairing a for loop and a for-in loop with each other can provide a reliable 
 *  way of accessing all data.
